Welcome to Freedom Den. This is a server where everyone can feel FREE to be themselves. We want to provide a place where anyone can speak their mind + have great time playing games, however we do have a FEW rules:

1. Respect each other, if you're in a vc, go ahead and mute if you or your background noise will be loud.
2. Ask before you do, ask if its ok to dm, ask if its ok to ask before inviting to your discords.
3. Do not solicit anyone for anything. its offensive and unprofessional to dm members about your business. there is a space for that here in the discord.
4. Build each other up, CLEAR BULLYING will not be tolerated.
5. Insults dont win a debate, dont be that asshole.
6. Dont ask Owners for money ( @Big_Duck-daddy + @BUDDHA) for money! We firmly Believe success is from hard work and cunning, not hand outs. we believe in hands up here. 
7. REMEMBER when someone is streaming, you dont play music, no racial slurs, and no slurs in general.
8. Race, gender, sexuality, religion, and politics is all touchy subjects, but we believe you have the right to DISCUSS THEM in the RIGHT PLACE. so please keep these items of subject to the Sensitive Chat.

*NO EAR RAPE IN VC YOU WILL ONLY BE WARNED TWICE BEFORE WE TAKE DISCIPLINARY ACTION*

We want this to be a free and fun space, if you abuse that fact, we have to become the assholes, so just dont do it.
If you ever have any questions or concerns contact one of the Mods or one of the owners, @Big_duck_daddy or @BUDDHA
Thank you for reading and please react below to show you read these rules.
