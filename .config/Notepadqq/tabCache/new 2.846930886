LIMITS OF THE BRAIN + Why do we only use half our brain?
MORALITY - WHERE DO WE DRAW THE LINE BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL 
AWARENESS - LOSING TOUCH WITH OUR BEING THROUGH YEARS OF CONDITIONING THRU THE MIND / EGO
CREATIVITY - WHERE DOES THIS SOURCE OF ENERGY, INSPIRATION, AND SPONTANUATY ARISE FROM?
MODERN LIFE VS SLAVERY (WE GOTTA BE FUCKING CAREFUL WITH THIS ONE)
